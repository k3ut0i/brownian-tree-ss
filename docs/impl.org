** TODO Multi-threaded Generator 
Using threads to speed up particle generation.
1. I need to figure out a way to compose particles generated in parallel.
2. Make sure helper functions are thread safe.
** TODO Sub graph recognition
Large Brownian Trees produce fractal-ish images. What are the common reoccurring patterns ?
I would like to analyze a series of generated images and find out how fractal a Brownian tree is?  
** TODO Scheme Bindings [0/1]
- [ ] Complete /bt.scm/.
