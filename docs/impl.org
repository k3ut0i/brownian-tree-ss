* Notes on implementation details
** TODO Multi-threaded Generator [0/2]
Using threads to speed up particle generation.
*** TODO Compose particles generated in parallel.
    I'll most likely need a thread manager for this part.
*** TODO Verify helper functions are thread safe.
** TODO Sub graph recognition
Large Brownian Trees produce fractal-ish images. What are the common reoccurring patterns ?
I would like to analyze a series of generated images and find out how fractal a Brownian tree is?  
** DONE Scheme Bindings [1/1]
   CLOSED: [2019-01-07 Mon 15:54]
- [X] Complete /bt.scm/.
** TODO Statistics
Before completing the implementation of multi-threaded generator, write up a simple report on final attributes(avg. out-of-bounds, total-steps, successful-steps etc..) of simple trees.
