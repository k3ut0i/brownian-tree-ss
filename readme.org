* Brownian Trees
Various methods to generate Brownian trees.  
Threaded methods are not completed.
Non deterministic vs deterministic computations need profiling.
See [[file:docs/impl.org][implementation docs]] for more info and [[file:docs/examples.org][examples]] for more sample images.

** Simple examples
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ time ./center_seeded.bin 200 200 4000 3                             
   Brownian Tree: w:200, h:200, Init:(100,100) to sample_200x200_4000_3.pbm
   ./center_seeded.bin 200 200 4000 3  15.58s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 15.592 total
